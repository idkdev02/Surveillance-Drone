# Surveillance-Drone
Description
<br>
Mentored by Vice Chancellor Renu Vig, we have developed a surveillance drone in collaboration with General Aeronautics Pvt. Ltd.,
Chandigarh, aimed at enhancing campus security. The drone is equipped with all essential components, including an Autopilot Orange
Cube, which enables fully autonomous flight along preset routes. This technology minimizes human intervention, allowing the drone to
navigate challenging locations, thereby enhancing both efficiency and safety across the campus.
